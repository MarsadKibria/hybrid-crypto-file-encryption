# hybrid-crypto-file-encryption
A Python implementation of hybrid file encryption using Kyber-like post-quantum cryptography and RSA. This project demonstrates secure file encryption and decryption for multiple users by combining the efficiency of symmetric key encryption (mock Kyber) with the robust key exchange capabilities of RSA.
